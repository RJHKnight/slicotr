\description{
Dual of a left/right polynomial matrix representation
}
\examples{
  To find the dual right (left) polynomial matrix representation of
  a given left (right) polynomial matrix representation, where the
  right and left polynomial matrix representations are of the form
  Q(s)*inv(P(s)) and inv(P(s))*Q(s) respectively.

# slicotr - An R interface to the SLICOT library.

A wrapper for the SLICOT control library, leaning heavily on the slycot python project.

SLICOT provides a large number of robust and stable numerical algorithms for computations of relavance to control theory and linear dynamic systems. 

Of particular note are the solvers for Riccati, Lyapunov and Sylvester equations.
